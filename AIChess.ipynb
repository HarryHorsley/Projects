For this we will need a function to evaluate the board and the minmax algorithm (move search) algorithm.\n\n4. <b>Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning</b> - similar to above however the algorithm 'prunes' the sections of the move tree which will never be taken as it is already worse than another section of the tree.

We would need a way to use the mouse to drag pieces. One way of doing this is to integrate a well known chess gui such as XBoard or UCI using the protocols that PyChess employs. I could also create the data structures for the chess pieces and rules myself which would make it easier to set up an interface with pygame. This would be much more work, however, to obtain the same functionality as PyChess.\n\n2. **Search algorithm**\n\nTo improve the eficiency of the pruning we could order the moves such that the more likely to be 'better' moves are evaluated first, such as pawn take moves. Particularly ordering the moves near to first move as it is relatively cheaper to sort these than the exponentially increasing number of moves deeper into the move tree.\n\n3. **Evaluation**\n\nWe could also improve the evaluation algorithm. Firstly, by adding in extra value for pieces in certain positions. For isntance, having pieces in the middle of the board is beneficial. Particularly knights and pawns. We could also add in different evaluations for different parts of the game. A bishop in the end game is far more valuable than beginning/middle game.\n\n4. **Move analysis**\n\nCould also incorporate move analysis from an exiting chess engine such as stockfish. Could do a game analysis at the end of a game. The core of the intelligence though will remain as I made it, it could just be a way of quantifying how good the intelligence is compared to professional engines."
